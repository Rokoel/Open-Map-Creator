## Code Contributions & Pull Requests üßë‚Äçüíª

Ready to write some code? Awesome! We use the standard GitHub Pull Request workflow for code changes.

**Standard Workflow (Recommended for most changes):**

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the project on GitHub.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_FORKED_USERNAME/Open-Map-Creator.git
    cd Open-Map-Creator
    ```
3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-layer-visibility`, `bugfix/pdf-export-scaling`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
4.  **Make Changes:** Write your code!
5.  **Code Style & Formatting:**
    *   Please, try to follow the existing code style.
    *   Write clear, understandable code and add comments where necessary, especially for complex logic.
6.  **Testing:**
    *   Currently, we rely primarily on manual testing. Please test your changes thoroughly in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox recommended).
    *   Describe the testing you performed in your Pull Request description.
    *   Contributions that add automated tests are highly welcome!
7.  **Commit Changes:** Use clear and concise commit messages. Following conventions like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) is encouraged but not strictly required.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add layer visibility toggle"
    ```
8.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
9.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to the original `Rokoel/Open-Map-Creator` repository on GitHub.
    *   GitHub should show a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch.
    *   Target the `main` branch of the original repository (unless otherwise specified).
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR. Explain *what* you changed and *why*.
    *   If your PR addresses an existing issue, link it using keywords like `Closes #123`.
    *   Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments based on feedback.

**Simpler Workflow (For typos, documentation, or very minor fixes):**

If you only need to make a small change to a single file (like fixing a typo), you can use GitHub's web interface directly:

1.  Navigate to the file in the main repository on GitHub.
2.  Click the **Edit** (pencil ‚úèÔ∏è) icon near the top right of the file view.
3.  Make your changes in the web editor.
4.  Scroll down and enter a concise commit message describing your change.
5.  Ensure "Create a **new branch**..." is selected.
6.  Click **Propose changes**.
7.  On the next screen, click **Create pull request**.

**Note:** This simpler method is great for quick fixes, but you won't be able to test your changes before submitting them. For anything more complex than a minor edit, please use the Standard Workflow.

## Development Setup

This project is designed to run directly in the browser without a build step for core functionality.

1.  Clone the repository (as described above).
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

That's it for setting up a development environment. As an alternative, you may setup any local server you'd like.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the **MIT License**, the same license that covers the project. See the `LICENSE` file for details.
